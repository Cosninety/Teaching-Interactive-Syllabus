      <h2>COURSE INFORMATION</h2>
      <h3>
        In this course we will use the Internet as a host and inspiration for
        art making. We will explore how to use the internet as a medium and muse
        to produce and exhibit interactive, participatory, and multimedia works
        of art. In the course we’ll learn about other artists engaged in this
        type of work and will study the historical context from which Web Art
        has emerged. We’ll learn about the conceptual implications of Web Art as
        well as the technical tools available to us. We’ll also learn about how
        the internet and technology can open up a wide range of new
        possibilities when it comes to reimagining traditional art forms such as
        typography, painting, sculpture, animations, and more!
      </h3>
